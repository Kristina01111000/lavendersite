consider using square instead of paypal/woocommerce or linking it together

stopped the store, disconnected from paypal, 
if we can't get square to work then she won't sell on the site


- look into square for wp: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-square/

- she wants preorders up by mid-january

- she's considering starting a freelance grantwritting business for non- profits in fall
- tell her whenever square is ready -> square is connected, set to update the invenotry on square, which is automatically updated onto wordpress -> this is what she wants

- sku entered, Category initial, First 2 letters of first work, first 3 letters of second (or first 5 if one word), 11

        - under tree
        - woodland garden


- make sure she has the sku on square and woo
- meeting on friday at 3:30


before meeting tomorrow:
- see if bundles can be made the way she wants (maybe not)
- make a new form for people applying to work there before the call tomorrow


For meeting:

- update issue caused by woocommerce products needing to allow square to edit them
- any updates from square to woocommerce need to be manually updated
- updates from woocommerce to square are done by the site
    - this is one of the reasons people don't like square
- read more shows instead of buy button when they are out of stock
- make sure she knows how to edit the pictures, tell her that when replacing a picture its way easier to remove the previous picture then add a new one instead of hitting the replace image button, its a little quirk of woocommerce that that creates a mess

- setting bundles to total price, small bundle would be discounted 33%, she can set the price change on square
- bundles let you pick the number of each plant on woocommerce, so im not sure it will transfer to square the way you want

2/17 meeting

- the bundles can be bought through square, people who want other things need to use the spreadsheet

- look into the best plugin to connect social media and the site, she wants changes to the homepage every so often
