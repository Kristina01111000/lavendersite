before meeting tomorrow:
- see if bundles can be made the way she wants (maybe not)
- make a new form for people applying to work there before the call tomorrow


For meeting:

- update issue caused by woocommerce products needing to allow square to edit them
- any updates from square to woocommerce need to be manually updated
- updates from woocommerce to square are done by the site
    - this is one of the reasons people don't like square
- read more shows instead of buy button when they are out of stock
- make sure she knows how to edit the pictures, tell her that when replacing a picture its way easier to remove the previous picture then add a new one instead of hitting the replace image button, its a little quirk of woocommerce that that creates a mess


2/17 meeting

- the bundles can be bought through square, people who want other things need to use the spreadsheet

- look into the best plugin to connect social media and the site, she wants changes to the homepage every so often
- get an update from her soon



email her on thursday: ask about bundles working, update on newsletter, podcast?, any issues with square working with woocommerce?
